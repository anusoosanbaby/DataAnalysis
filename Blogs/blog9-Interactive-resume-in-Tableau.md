# Building an Interactive Resume with Tableau: Stand Out in the Job Market.

Creating a resume in Tableau can be an innovative way to showcase your professional profile, especially if you're in a field related to data analysis, business intelligence, or any role where data visualization skills are valued. Tableau allows you to present your experience, skills, and accomplishments in an interactive and visually appealing format. Here's a general guide on how to create a resume in Tableau:

## 1. Plan Your Content
First, outline what you want to include in your resume. Common sections include:

- ***Contact Information***: Your name, email, LinkedIn profile, and other relevant contact details.
- ***Professional Summary***: A brief overview of your professional background.
- ***Work Experience***: Your job history, including company names, roles, and achievements.
- ***Education***: Schools attended, degrees, and certifications.
- ***Skills***: Both technical and soft skills.
- ***Projects***: Significant projects you've worked on or led, emphasizing outcomes and your role.
- ***Certifications and Awards***: Any relevant certifications, awards, or recognitions.
## 2. Gather Your Data
Compile all the information in a structured format. Excel or Google Sheets can be helpful for this task. You'll need to import this data into Tableau, so organize it in a way that will facilitate easy visualization. Clean and format the data appropriately. For instance, you might have columns for dates, roles, companies, descriptions, and outcomes in your work experience section. Additionally, please collect logos and photos for each organization. If you want to use them in graphs as shapes, save the logos in C:\Users\cithomas\Documents\My Tableau Repository\Shapes.
## 3. Start with Tableau
Open Tableau and import the data prepared in Excel or Google Sheets for visualization. Create visuals for each section of your resume. For example, consider creating a timeline for your work experience and education, bar charts or skill meters for your technical skills, and a tree map for projects or certifications.


## 4. Design Your Dashboard
Once you have created visuals for each section, you can start designing your dashboard.

- ***Layout***: Arrange the sections logically, similar to how you would on a traditional resume. Ensure it's easy to follow and aesthetically pleasing.
- ***Interactivity***: Add filters or actions that allow viewers to interact with your resume. For example, clicking on a company name could display more details about your role and achievements there.
- ***Customization***: Use colors and fonts that align with your personal brand but keep it professional.

## 5. Finalize and Share
- ***Test***: Ensure all links, filters, and interactive elements work as intended. It's also a good idea to have someone else review it.
- ***Publish***: Once you're satisfied, publish your resume to Tableau Public or save it as a PDF if you need a static version. Make sure to include a link to your Tableau Public profile in your job applications or digital portfolio.
